# Arduino Core for STM32L4 Ladybug Flight Controller

<b>NOTE</b>: This is a fork of Thomas Roell's [arduino-STM32L4](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) repository.  This fork is meant for working with the Ladybug Flight Controller board.  Unless you are working with that specific board, you should be using the master branch of the repository.

If you do have a Ladybug Flight Controller board, follow the directions on our [wiki](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/wiki/Hackflight-LadybugFC-Wiki)  to install this fork.
